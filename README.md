## Features

- Syncs IP blocks from Wordfence to Cloudflare Firewall Rules
- DNS-level blocking to reduce server resource usage
- Automatic cron-based syncing
- Manual "Sync Now" + "Cleanup Now" buttons
- Cloudflare rule reconciliation (detect drift)
- Expired block cleanup and retry logic
- Built-in logging and admin UI
- Multisite-compatible (per-site sync)

---

## How It Works

- On sync, the plugin reads Wordfence's current block list
- It pushes valid IPs to Cloudflare's WAF using their API
- Expired or removed blocks are cleaned up from Cloudflare
- A database table tracks block history, sync logs, and retry attempts
